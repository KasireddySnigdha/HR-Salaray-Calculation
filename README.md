# HR-Salaray-Calculation

In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model that can accurately calculate employee salaries based on their experience levels. Traditionally, manually calculating salaries for each employee can be a tedious task, especially considering that salary values often follow non-linear patterns. Linear functions are not sufficient for this calculation process since most companies have polynomial salary structures.

To address this challenge, we will employ the polynomial linear regression algorithm to create a solution. By utilizing this algorithm, we can capture the non-linear relationships between experience levels and corresponding salaries. This will enable us to develop a more accurate and efficient method for determining employee salaries.
